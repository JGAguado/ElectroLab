ðŸ›  Assembly 
===========

The |Product| can be ordered fully assembled or partially, where all the :term:`SMD`
components are already assembled and you only need to assemble and solder the :term:`THT`
components, such as the pinheads or the potentiometers.

.. Note::
    Assembling all the :term:`THT` components is a tough job since there are more than 500 soldering points. 
    Order this version only if you have some experience with soldering electronics.

For making easier the :term:`THT` components assembly, the |Product| comes with a *Stencil board* that will 
help you with the pinheads positioning for soldering. For an optimal assembly, follow this steps:

1. Mount the screws on the |Product| as indicated, with the screw head comming from the bottom side (the one with :term:`SMD` components) and add a nut on the top side of the board (the one with the QR code).
2. Start with the pinheads. Place **all** the pinheads on the |Product| top side. Make sure you introduce the short side of the pin on the :term:`PCB`.
3. Once you have mounted all the pins, place gently the *Stencil board* over it. Be patient, some pins (like the individual pin from the signal generator or the Gas sensor) may become troubly rebels. Once they are all in place, screw the other 4 nuts to the screws to secure the two boards together.
4. With the pinheads correctly secured, proceed to the soldering of each individual pin on the **ElectroLab's bottom side**. Pay special attention to those solderings close to :term:`SMD` components for avoiding any damage.
5. After soldering all the pinheads, the screws can be removed and the boards separated.
6. Continue with each individual :term:`THT` component, starting from the smaller like the switches and sensors. In this case is highly recomended to:

   1. Place the component on top side of the board
   2. If it has long pins that can bend (like the :term:`LDR` sensor), bend the pins to keep it in place.
   3. If not, press it to hold it in position while soldering.
   4. Start by soldering just one of the pins. 
   5. Check if the sensor is still in the correct position and correct it if not.
   6. Solder the rest of the pins and cut the excess length of them.
