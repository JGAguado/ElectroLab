🚀 Example circuits
================
Now that we know the way to operate with the |Product| let's get into some real work.

Through the upcomming docs, you will see interactive illustrations like this one:

.. raw:: html
        
    <iframe src="_static/Circuits/PB_LEDs/Circuit.html" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: none;"></iframe>

You can navigate through each step forward ➡️ and backward ⬅️, or enter directly the step you want.
You can also visualize all the steps at once by clicking on the 👁 (eye icon).

Feel free to experiment with the following tested circuits:

   examples/1_analog/main
   examples/2_digital/main
   examples/3_oscillators/main
